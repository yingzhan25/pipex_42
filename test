Basic Tests

    Two commands with pipe
	./pipex infile "grep hello" "wc -l" outfile
	(Should behave like: < infile grep hello | wc -l > outfile)

Edge Cases

    Empty commands
	./pipex infile "" "" outfile
	(Should handle errors appropriately)

Non-existent first command

	./pipex infile "nonexistentcmd" "wc" outfile
	(Should give command not found error)

Non-existent second command

	./pipex infile "ls" "nonexistentcmd" outfile
	(Should give command not found error)

Non-existent input file

	./pipex non_existent_file "cat" "wc" outfile
	(Should handle file opening error)

Permission Tests

No read permission on input file
	chmod 000 infile
	./pipex infile "cat" "cat" outfile
	(Should handle permission error)

No write permission on output file
	touch outfile
	chmod 400 outfile
	./pipex infile "echo hello" "cat" outfile
	(Should handle permission error)

Complex Commands

Commands with quotes

	./pipex infile "grep 'hello world'" "awk '{print \$1}'" outfile

Commands with environment variables

	./pipex infile "echo \$HOME" "tr '/' '\n'" outfile

Multiple flags/options

	./pipex infile "ls -la /tmp" "grep test" "wc -w" outfile
